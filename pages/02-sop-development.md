The development of the SOP followed the approach described in Przeslawski et al. (2023). Briefly, experts and users in marine imagery and habitat classification were invited to join a working group and contribute to the content of the SOP. The SOP will be maintained as part of a broader suite of sampling methods used for marine monitoring established by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io).
