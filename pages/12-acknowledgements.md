The authors would like to thank James Seager (SeaGIS.com.au) for support with software and both James Seager and Ray Scott for stereo equipment and advice. The design was inspired by the work of Rick Starr and adapted with the expertise of John Fitzhardinge. Syntactic foam was donated by Total Marine Technology. Cultural guidance in trialling this method on Wadandi Sea Country was provided by Dr Wayne Webb and Iszaac Webb, and on Wudjari Sea Country by Dr Doc Reynolds and Donna Beach respectively. Collaboration with Traditional Owner Rangers to deploy this Boordiya camera system and annotate the imagery provided feedback to optimise the workflows presented here. Nicole Middelton and Darren Phillips of Parks Australia provided advice and encouragement. David Hannen and Chris Biessel completed design improvements and fabrication, with technical drawings made by Felix Spencer. The initial development of the camera system was supported by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (Project Number 2019-099). Data collection and Standard Operating Protocol workshop was supported with funding from the Australian Government through the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub and Parks Australia.
