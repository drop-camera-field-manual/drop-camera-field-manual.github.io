We recommend the drop camera be deployed for a standard duration, with trials indicating five minutes bottom time allows any sediment suspended during the landing to settle, resulting in clear footage of the habitat. Shorter deployments may be sufficient for areas with limited sediment, and the ideal deployment length should be determined based on study objectives. Local fishing vessels fitted with trap retrieval equipment such as a swinging davit arm or a ‘pot-tipper’ and winch are ideal for deploying and retrieving both the stereo and mono-video systems, especially in deeper waters (Fig. 3). These vessels are usually suited to the local sea conditions, and the involvement of experienced commercial skippers may provide valuable logistical and local knowledge. Due to the weight of the stereo-system with weights attached (~50 kg), we strongly encourage the engagement of commercial fishers and deckhands who are experienced at deploying weighted traps and their expertise will be beneficial and likely result in better Occupational Health and Safety outcomes. A field deployment checklist is provided in Tables 1-5.

### Field Deployment Checklist

We provide here a series of checklists that ensure that all data is collected consistently in the field.


#### Pre-field work

During the settlement time on the seabed, contact between the vessel and camera system can be maintained with the drop camera via the ropes, however no tension should be held on the ropes to ensure that the drop camera is not moved from the sampling location. Alternatively, the rope with floats attached can be dropped and retrieved once the sample time has elapsed.

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>Once the drop camera has been retrieved, it should remain on the deck or securely fastened to the pot tipper or davit arm as the vessel transits to the next sampling location. The upcoming unique sample code should be shown to all cameras. Frequent checking and resynchronisation of cameras should occur to ensure that all cameras are recording, lights are turned on and any issues with loss of stereo calibration due to dropped frames are accounted for. If any cameras stop recording during the recording period, then all cameras should be restarted to maintain synchronicity.
