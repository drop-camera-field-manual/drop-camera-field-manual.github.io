The BOSS has two variants: a stereo system (Fig. 2) and a lighter-weight mono system (Fig. 3). Both consist of a sturdy aluminium frame to secure and protect the camera equipment, a flotation compartment at the top and a bolt-on base weight. The buoyancy and weighting counteract to create a self-righting action, with flotation provided by compression-resistant syntactic foam or subsurface floats. The weighting and compression-resistant buoyancy means that no adjustments are necessary to work, up to the limits of the camera housings and buoyancy (i.e. 1,000 m). When weights are removed, either system can be safely carried by two people (i.e. &lt;35 kg). In the stereo version, eight horizontally-facing cameras are secured to brackets aligned in four stereo pairs at 90-degree intervals (Fig. 2c), and an optional downward-facing camera can be mounted within the buoyancy compartment to collect more traditional imagery (Fig. 4a). Brackets are provided for four lights. In the stereo version, camera brackets are secured to a common central column (Fig. 2a and 4a) and removed from the outer frame to reduce the risk of any physical impacts on the outer frame compromising the stereo calibration. By using small-form action cameras with external battery packs and large capacity memory cards, it is possible to film continuously for 12 hours and not require the camera housings to be opened until the end of the day, thus reducing risks to equipment, calibration stability, and substantially increasing efficiency in the field. Further information on cameras and photogrammetry are provided in Supporting Information 1. In the stereo system, each pair of cameras is separated by 500 mm, with the top camera in each pair angled 8 degrees downward and the bottom camera horizontal (Fig. 1) to provide adequate separations and overlap of imagery (Langlois et al. 2020).
